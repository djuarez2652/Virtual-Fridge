# SEO Week 4 Project - Virtual Fridge

Hosted on PythonAnywhere: try it out at [Virtual Fridge](https://seowk4virtualfridge.pythonanywhere.com)

## Project Story

We wanted to create a web app that could track food items and generate meal ideas for those moments of staring into the fridge/pantry in silence and waiting for a lunch idea to magically appear in your mind.

A logged in user can add or delete items at the *In Fridge* page, and each item can be tracked with an expiration date. The *In Fridge* page displays the list of items and persists after log out.

In the *Generate Recipes* page, the user can select food / ingredients from their *In Fridge* list, and the website would generate a recipe that uses as many of those foods as possible, providing a list of necessary ingredients, a URL to the source of the recipe, and a URL to a page with corresponding nutrition values. 

## Possible Future Steps:

We would like to add more account security to the users, along with handy features like "forget password" and "remember me".

We also want to add a feature such that the user can upload pictures of the food label / fresh produce and the website will use AI assistance, such sending the input to a ChatGPT API, to parse or generate the expiration date.
